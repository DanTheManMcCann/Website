<!-- This is the main page for the website.
    I want there to be an index page, the base page, it will show a 
    nice picture of me and a summary as you scroll down the page, and maybe 
    a current project page.
    There will also be links to projects that I have done/plan on doing. 
    I'll also have links to my other sites, such as medium, linkedin, github, 
    maybe social media(idk).
    Projects will consist of bots and websites and also videos I film.
    Also I could have a featured articles section.
    Also I could have a section of fun - me surfing, etc.
